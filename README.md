# Grow Patch
------------


**By: Pykess**


A major bug in the vanilla game is that Grow is framerate-dependent. This means that during periods of low FPS, bullets from Grow would scale exponentially more than they should. Conversely, during periods of high FPS, bullets from Grow would have significantly less damage than intended. This patch fixes this bug.
